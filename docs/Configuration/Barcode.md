# Barcode Recognition Setup

1) Setup an extractFromBarcode rule on the appropriate node  
2) Install the Softek SDK. You can download the latest version from:  
[Windows SDK
v8.1.2](http://http://softeksoftware.co.uk/download/barcode_sdk/windows/softek_barcode_sdk_8_1_2.zip)  
 [Linux SDK v8.1.2](http://bardecode.com/barcode_linux.tar.gz)

Libraries need to be copied to `/usr/lib/java`, `/usr/lib/`,
`C:\\Windows\\System32` or wherever the java.library.path is pointing.


For a list of all versions go to [Bardecode](http://www.bardecode.com/en1/quick-download/), although a different license may need to be loaded via the License property.
